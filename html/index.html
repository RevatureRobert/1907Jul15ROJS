    What is html?
        HyperText Markup Language
        provides a structure for a browser to display
    Is html a programming language?
        no, it simply gives something for the browser to show

We have tags inside of html
First, we need a tag to tell the browser what kind of file it is
-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
then we need to have the important tags for html

We start with the root tag
    The root tag surrounds the other tags inside the document

    the root tag inside an html doc is html
    we have an opening tag and a closing tag


    We can see the benefits of working with vsc

    What is an IDE?
        Integrated Development Environment
    Why do we use IDE's?

-->

<html>
  <!-- 
    now we need to add in the rest of it
        we need to add meta data
    meta data is:
        data about data

-->

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>title of the page</title>
  </head>
  <!--the last important inside an html
        What we are displaying 
-->
  <body>
    lots of different thinggs
    <h1>this is a heading</h1>
    <h2>this is another heading</h2>
    <h3>this is a third heading</h3>
    <h4>does it shrink forever?</h4>
    <h5>can you see me?</h5>
    <h6>is this the last one?</h6>

    <p>
      doesnt is mmake sense everybody for the p tag to be a <h1>this is a block element</h1>paragraph and
      <span>this is an inline element</span>
      for paragraphs to make paragraphs. Isnt this paragraph
      inception??????!!!!!!!
    </p>
    <p>does this end up on the same line</p>

    <!--what all will this ide do?
        a hundred line breaks
        br*100
    -->

    <!-- is comment this out after i type it

        ctrl+shift+frwrd slash and ctrl+frwrd slash -->
    <!-- 
    we have the opening and closing tags, then we have the content inside
        of them, an html element is all of this together
 -->
    <!-- inline and block elements in html
    block: those that take the entire width of the page
    inline: those that be placed in the same line

    <ol> This is an ordered list
        <li>this is a list item</li><!-- this is a list item -->

            These attributes can be used by all elements
                these are known as global attribute
        Others, such as action and method that are specific to <form>
                are called local attributes
