    Javascript is NOT java
        JavaScript has nothing to do with Java
    A few things to know about js
        it is a programming language
        it is a scripting
        it is interpreted
            the browser will run js line by line
        it is loosely typed
        it is dynamic

*/

/* 
    js is loosely typed
        because variables can hold and have 
        transferred to them any datatype

    myVar=true
    myVar="this string"

    how can we declare a variable?
        var x= 454;
        y=5;
    as of es2015, es6
        let z=2
        const a=3

    const does not change

    Scope
        Global      is accessible throughout the program
        Function    is accessible throughout the function
        Local       is accessible throughout the block of code "{}"

//variable names
//  cant keyword
/*      let var = 4
    only caracters that can begin a variable is: _,$,letters

*/
let v1=5;
// let v;

//  Operators
//      unary, binary, ternary
/* 
            unary works with one operand
    typeof returns the type of the argument
    isNaN   returns a boolean whether the argument is a number
    !   not operator (negation)
    -x  flips the sign of the number
    +x  returns the same number, or converts to a number
    ++x pre-increment
    x++ post-increment
    --x pre-decrement
    x-- post-decrement

            binary works with two operands
    +   addition
    -   subtraction
    *   multiplication
    /   division
    **  exponent
    %   modulus
    +=  addition assigment
    -=  subtraction assignment
    *=  multiplication assignment
    /=  division assignment
    **= exponent assignment
    %=  modulus assignment
and &&  logical and operator
or  ||  logical or operator 
xor ^   exclusive or
    <   less than
    >   greater than
    <=  less than or equal to
    >=  greater than or equal to
    =   assignment operator
    ==  comparison operator
    === strict comparison
